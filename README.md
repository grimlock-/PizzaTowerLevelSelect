# PizzaTowerLevelSelect
A mod for the video game Pizza Tower

Some of the code is weird and bad because I use [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) which doesn't support structs with PT.

The scripts in util is stuff to help me during development. They're not applied when making release packages
